          <div class="EMA"><b>Full validation of an analytical method -EMA-</b> <br>A full method validation should be performed for any analytical method whether new or based upon
literature.
The main objective of method validation is to demonstrate the reliability of a particular method for the
determination of an analyte concentration in a specific biological matrix, such as blood, serum, plasma,
urine, or saliva. Moreover, if an anticoagulant is used, validation should be performed using the same
anticoagulant as for the study samples. Generally a full validation should be performed for each
species and matrix concerned.
In some cases, it may be problematic for validation purposes to obtain an identical matrix compared to
the matrix of the study samples. A suitable alternative matrix may be used, e.g. synthetically prepared
cerebrospinal fluid, if justified.
The main characteristics of a bioanalytical method that are essential to ensure the acceptability of the
performance and the reliability of analytical results are: selectivity, lower limit of quantification, the
response function and calibration range (calibration curve performance), accuracy, precision, matrix
effects, stability of the analyte(s) in the biological matrix and stability of the analyte(s) and of the
internal standard in the stock and working solutions and in extracts under the entire period of storage
and processing conditions.
Usually one analyte or drug has to be determined, but on occasions it may be appropriate to measure
more than one analyte. This may involve two different drugs, but can also involve a parent drug with
its metabolites, or the enantiomers or isomers of a drug. In these cases the principles of validation and
analysis apply to all analytes of interest. </div>

        <div class="flex-container">

            <div class="EMA"><b>Reference standards-EMA-</b></br> During method validation and analysis of study samples, a blank biological matrix will be spiked with
the analyte(s) of interest using solutions of reference standard(s) to prepare calibration standards,
quality control samples and stability samples. In addition, suitable internal standard(s) (IS) can be
added during sample processing in chromatographic methods.

It is important that the quality of the reference standard and IS is ensured, as the quality (purity) may
affect the outcome of the analysis, and therefore the outcome of the study data. Therefore the
reference standards used during the validation and study sample analysis should be obtained from an
authentic and traceable source.
Suitable reference standards include compendial standards, commercially available standards, or
sufficiently characterised standards prepared in-house or by an external non-commercial organisation.
A certificate of analysis is required to ensure purity and provide information on storage conditions,
expiration date and batch number of the reference standard.
The use of such standards is not needed for IS, as long as the suitability for use is demonstrated, e.g.
lack of analytical interference is shown for the substance itself or any impurities thereof. A certificate of
analysis is not required.
When mass-spectrometry (MS) detection is used in the bioanalytical method, a stable isotope-labelled
IS is recommended to be used whenever possible. However, it is essential that the labelled standard is
of the highest isotope purity and that no isotope exchange reaction occurs. The presence of any
unlabelled analyte should be checked and if relative amounts of unlabelled analyte are detected the
potential influence has to be evaluated during method validation.</div>

      <div class="flex-container">

          <div class="EMA"><b>Selectivity-EMA-</b></br>The analytical method should be able to differentiate the analyte(s) of interest and IS from
endogenous components in the matrix or other components in the sample. Selectivity should be
proved using at least 6 individual sources of the appropriate blank matrix, which are individually
analysed and evaluated for interference. Use of fewer sources is acceptable in case of rare matrices.

<div class="flex-container"> <div style="background-color:#ffa1a1"> <b>Acceptance criteria</b> Normally, absence of interfering components is accepted where the response is less than 20% of the
lower limit of quantification for the analyte and 5% for the internal standard.
</div></div>

It may also be necessary to investigate the extent of any interference caused by metabolites of the
drug(s), interference from degradation products formed during sample preparation, and interference
from possible co-administered medications. Co-medications normally used in the subject population
studied which may potentially interfere should be taken into account at the stage of method validation,
or on a study specific and compound specific base.
The possibility of back-conversion of a metabolite into parent analyte during the successive steps of
the analysis (including extraction procedures or in the MS source) should also be evaluated, when
relevant (i.e. potentially unstable metabolites e.g. acidic metabolites to ester, unstable N-oxides or
glucuronide metabolites, lactone-ring structures). The extent of back-conversion should be established
and the impact on the study results discussed. It is acknowledged that this evaluation will not be
possible early during drug development of a new chemical entity when the metabolism is not yet
evaluated. However, it is expected that this issue is taken into account and a partial validation is
performed if relevant as further knowledge regarding metabolism of the active substance is gained
during drug development.
It is recognized that in some cases it is very difficult to obtain the metabolites of interest. Alternatively,
back-conversion of a metabolite can be checked by applying incurred sample reanalysis. However, in
this case potential back conversion during sample processing cannot be ruled out.</div>

             <div class="EMA"><b>Calibration curve-EMA-</b></br>The response of the instrument with regard to the concentration of analyte should be known, and
should be evaluated over a specified concentration range. The calibration standards should be
prepared in the same matrix as the matrix of the intended study samples by spiking the blank matrix
with known concentrations of the analyte. There should be one calibration curve for each analyte
studied in the method validation and for each analytical run.
Ideally, before carrying out the validation of the analytical method it should be known what
concentration range is expected. This range should be covered by the calibration curve range, defined
by the LLOQ being the lowest calibration standard and the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ), being
the highest calibration standard. The range should be established to allow adequate description of the
pharmacokinetics of the analyte of interest.
A minimum of six calibration concentration levels should be used, in addition to the blank sample
(processed matrix sample without analyte and without IS) and a zero sample (processed matrix with
IS). Each calibration standard can be analysed in replicate.
A relationship which can simply and adequately describe the response of the instrument with regard to
the concentration of analyte should be applied. The blank and zero samples should not be taken into
consideration to calculate the calibration curve parameters.
The calibration curve parameters should be reported (slope and intercept in case of linear fit). In
addition, the back calculated concentrations of the calibration standards should be presented together
with the calculated mean accuracy values (see definition of Accuracy below). All the available (or
acceptable) curves obtained during validation, with a minimum of 3 should be reported.

Although the calibration curve should preferably be prepared using freshly spiked samples, it is allowed
to use previously prepared and stored calibration samples, if supported by appropriate stability data.
<div class="flex-container">
    <div style="background-color:#ffa1a1"><b>Acceptance criteria</b> The back calculated concentrations of the calibration standards should be within ±15% of the nominal
    value, except for the LLOQ for which it should be within ±20%. At least 75% of the calibration

    replicates are used, the criteria (within ±15% or ±20% for LLOQ) should also be fulfilled for at least
    50% of the calibration standards tested per concentration level. In case a calibration standard does not
    comply with these criteria, this calibration standard sample should be rejected, and the calibration
    curve without this calibration standard should be re-evaluated, including regression analysis. In case
    all replicates of the LLOQ or the ULOQ calibration standard are rejected then the batch should be
    rejected from the validation, the possible source of the failure be determined and the method revised
    (if necessary). If the next validation batch also fails, then the method should be revised before

                 <div class="EMA"><b>Matrix effect-EMA-</b></br> Matrix effects should be investigated when using mass spectrometric methods, using at least 6 lots of
blank matrix from individual donors. Pooled matrix should not be used.
For each analyte and the IS, the matrix factor (MF) should be calculated for each lot of matrix, by
calculating the ratio of the peak area in the presence of matrix (measured by analysing blank matrix
spiked after extraction with analyte), to the peak area in absence of matrix (pure solution of the
analyte). The IS normalised MF should also be calculated by dividing the MF of the analyte by the MF
of the IS.


<div class="flex-container"> <div style="background-color:#ffa1a1"> <b>Acceptance criteria</b>
The CV of the IS-normalised MF calculated from the 6 lots of matrix should not be greater
than 15 %. This determination should be done at a low and at a high level of concentration (maximum
of 3 times the LLOQ and close to the ULOQ).</div></div>
If this approach cannot be used, for instance in the case of on-line sample preparation, the variability
of the response from lot to lot should be assessed by analysing at least 6 lots of matrix, spiked at a
low and at a high level of concentration (maximum of 3 times the LLOQ and close to the ULOQ). The
validation report should include the peak areas of the analyte and of the IS and the calculated
concentration for each individual sample.

<div class="flex-container"> <div style="background-color:#ffa1a1"> <b>Acceptance criteria</b> The overall CV calculated for the concentration should not be
greater than 15 %.
</div></div>

If the matrix is difficult to obtain, less than 6 different lots of matrix may be used, but this should be
justified. However, matrix effects should still be investigated. If a formulation for injection to be administered to the subjects or animals contains excipients known
to be responsible for matrix effects, for instance polyethylene glycol or polysorbate, matrix effects
should be studied with matrix containing these excipients, in addition to blank matrix. The matrix used
for this evaluation should be obtained from subjects or animals administered the excipient, unless it
has been demonstrated that the excipient is not metabolised or transformed in-vivo. The effect of the
excipients can be studied by the determination of the MF or by a dilution study of a study sample with
a high concentration with blank matrix not containing the excipient.
In addition to the normal matrix it is recommended to investigate matrix effects on other samples e.g.
haemolysed and hyperlipidaemic plasma samples. If samples from special populations (such as renally
or hepatically impaired populations) are to be analysed it is also recommended to study matrix effects
using matrix from such populations</div>

                  <div class="EMA"><b>Stability-EMA-</b></br>Evaluation of stability should be carried out to ensure that every step taken during sample preparation
and sample analysis, as well as the storage conditions used do not affect the concentration of the
analyte.</br>
Stability should be ensured for every step in the analytical method, meaning that the conditions
applied to the stability tests, such as sample matrix, anticoagulant, container materials, storage and
analytical conditions should be similar to those used for the actual study samples. Reference to data
published in the literature is not considered sufficient.</br>
Stability of the analyte in the studied matrix is evaluated using low and high QC samples (blank matrix
spiked with analyte at a concentration of a maximum of 3 times the LLOQ and close to the ULOQ)
which are analysed immediately after preparation and after the applied storage conditions that are to
be evaluated. The QC samples are analysed against a calibration curve, obtained from freshly spiked
calibration standards, and the obtained concentrations are compared to the nominal concentrations.

<div class="flex-container"> <div style="background-color:#ffa1a1"> <b>Acceptance criteria</b> The mean concentration at each level should be within ±15% of the nominal concentration.
</div></div>

Stability of the stock and working solutions should be tested with an appropriate dilution, taking into
consideration the linearity and measuring range of the detector.</br>
Stability studies should investigate the different storage conditions over time periods that equal or
exceed those applied to the actual study samples.</br>
</br>
<div class="flex-container"> <div> The following stability tests should be evaluated:</br>
• stability of the stock solution and working solutions of the analyte and internal standard,</br>
• freeze and thaw stability of the analyte in the matrix from freezer storage conditions to room
temperature or sample processing temperature,</br>
• short term stability of the analyte in matrix at room temperature or sample processing
temperature,</br>
• long term stability of the analyte in matrix stored in the freezer,</div></div>

<div class="flex-container"> <div> In addition the following tests should be performed if applicable:</br>
• stability of the processed sample at room temperature or under the storage conditions to be
used during the study (dry extract or in the injection phase),</br>
• on-instrument/ autosampler stability of the processed sample at injector or autosampler
temperature.
</div></div>
</br>
<div class="flex-container"> <div> <b>Regarding the freeze and thaw stability:</b> The QC samples are stored and frozen in the freezer at the
intended temperature and thereafter thawed at room or processing temperature. After complete
thawing, samples are refrozen again applying the same conditions. At each cycle, samples should be
frozen for at least 12 hours before they are thawed. The number of cycles in the freeze-thaw stability
should equal or exceed that of the freeze/thaw cycles of study samples.
</div></div>
</br>
<div class="flex-container"> <div> <b>Regarding long term stability of the analyte in matrix stored in the freezer:</b> The QC samples should be
stored in the freezer under the same storage conditions and at least for the same duration as the study
samples. For small molecules it is considered acceptable to apply a bracketing approach, i.e. in case
stability has been proved for instance at -70°C and -20°C, it is not necessary to investigate the
stability at temperatures in between. For large molecules (such as peptides and proteins) stability
should be studied at each temperature at which study samples will be stored. Study samples may be
used in addition to QC samples, but the exclusive use of study samples is not considered sufficient as
the nominal concentrations of those samples is not known. The results of the evaluation of long term
stability should be available before the study report is issued.
</div></div>
</br>
<div class="flex-container"> <div>  It is not needed to study the stability at each
concentration level of working solutions and a bracketing approach can be used. It is not needed to
study the stability of stable-isotope labelled internal standards if it is demonstrated that no isotope
exchange reactions occur under the same conditions as the stability of the analyte was demonstrated.
</div></div>
</br>
<div class="flex-container"> <div> <b>In case of a multi-analyte study and specific for bioequivalence studies</b>  attention should be paid to
stability of the analytes in the matrix containing all the analytes.</div></div>
</br>
<div class="flex-container"> <div> Sufficient attention should be paid to the stability of the analyte in the sampled matrix directly after
blood sampling of subjects and further preparation before storage, to ensure that the obtained
